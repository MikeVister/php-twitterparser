Works for any Twitter username.  Parses the public XML feed, no login necessary.
Requires a PHP-writeable cache directory.  Defaults is subdirectory cache/.
If twitter is failwhaling it will load from cache.  Recaches at most once per
60 seconds, unless already processing.  Keep this set to a sane number or
you'll max out the API limit for your server IP.

Maxtweets is the number of tweets to pull.

Most of this was taken from existing open-source code on the 'net, credit given
where due.  Any improvements welcomed.  This code is without warranty.  Use at
your own risk.
